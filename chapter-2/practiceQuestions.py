# write them?
# -> True and False

# 2. What are the three Boolean operators?
# -> and , or, not 

# 3. Write out the truth tables of each Boolean operator (that is, every

# True and False
# False and False

# True or True

# not (5 > 4) -> False
# (5 > 4) or (3 == 5) -> True
# not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5)) -> False
# (True and True) and (True == False) -> False
# (not False) or (not True) -> True

# 5. What are the six comparison operators?

# in a for loop?

# 13. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop.
# Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using
